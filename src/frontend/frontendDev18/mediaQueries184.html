Media queries
    Media queries are essentially an if statement for css. 
        A condition is set, and if that condition is met, then the css rules within it will be applied. 
    Typically, media queries are used for changing the css of a website based on screen size.

    Syntax
        @media <media type> (<media features>) {
            <CSS Rules>
        } 

    Media types can be set to all, print, screen, or speech.
        The all type, which is the most common type and the default in HTML5, applies the media query to every media type.

        If you want the stlyles within the media query to apply only when the web page is printed, you can use print instead.
    
    The complete list of media features is long, but these are the most common:
        width
        height
        orientation

        p {
            font-size: 14px;
        }
        
        @media all and (min-width: 800px) {
            p {
                font-size: 24px;
            }
        }

        The code above is saying that the paragraph should generally display at 14 pixels. The should only be displayed at 24 pixels when the broswer has a width of 800 pixels or greater.
