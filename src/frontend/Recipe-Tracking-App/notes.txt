Project Description: Recipe CRUD

A CRUD application allows a user to create, read, update, or delete selected data.

You will build the interface of a food recipe CRUD app. The interface won't use a database or an API to store the data; it will require you to use React's useState() hook.

Learning Objectives

This project is designed to test your ability to work with rendering and state management using React. Before taking on this project, you should be comfortable with the learning objectives listed below:

    Installing packages via NPM;
    Running tests from the command line;
    Writing React function components;
    Using hooks like useState();
    Debugging React code through console output;

Project steps to complete:

    Write code that passes all test in the Qualified assessment in this lesson.

    Write code that passes all of the requirements outlined below, and submit your GitHub repo link to the Thinkful team in the next session.

Requirements to pass:

    All tests are passing in Qualified;
    A user can create new recipes;
    A list of the existing recipes is displayed to the user;
    A user can delete a recipe;
    The app uses the useState() hook;
    Data is displayed in a table (such as the one provided in the starter code);
    The app looks like the provided mockup;

Go the Extra Mile

    Remember, it's most important to meet the requirements listed above. But if you do any of the things listed here, you'll receive feedback that you've done exceptional work:

        Use of <> and </>. You haven't learned fragments yet, so any use shows that you are researching independently;
        Use of any pure functions;
        Use of any clear and informative variable or function names;


Remember the single-responsibility principle!
