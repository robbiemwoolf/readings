CSS Frameworks
Common components and utilities

overview: learn to include common components on your website and use utility classes in the Bootstrap framework to style text and containers

What else can Bootstrap do?
    CSS frameworks gained popularity through the grid system, but many of these frameworks now also include common components and utility classes that you can add to your website.

    Common components
        For demonstrations of available compenetns, visit Bootstrap's page on compoenents
            https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/alerts/

        Most common:
            alerts
            buttons
            card
            forms
            jumbotron
            navs

            These components require the use of certain classes and structures to make them work. Note that the majority of these are intended to be used inside of a container, row, or column.

        Although you can use these components, its suggested that you actually avoid them until you've learned more about using JavaScript with HTML and CSS.

    Include common components   
        Add a styled button to your page. To keep things organized, make sure that it appears inside of a .col class. Try changing the color and size using the various classes described.

        Next, add a card to your page. Try placing it inside a column and adding or removing elements.


Borders and colors
    There are a few classes in Bootstrap that allow you to add borders and colors to your containing elements. These are easy to use and can be useful for quickly adding a bit of style to your code.

        Bootstrap: Colors https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/utilities/colors/ 

        Use the .border border-primary class, the .tex-danger class, and the .bg-dark class on your page.

Text 
    Bootstrap allows utility classes that you can use to modify text in a variety of ways.

    Perhaps the most useful text-modification classes are those that allow you to align your text quickly, like .text-center 

    Align your text 
        use the .text-center class on your index.html page. Notice from the documentation that this class also allows for responsive text

Spacing
    Bootstrap also provides a few utility classes that make it easy to add margins or padding to elements.

    Add margin and padding
        Try using the .py-2 and .mb-4 class. What does each abbreviation represent?
            p is for padding
            m is for margin
            y is for the top and bottom 
            b is for margin bottom and padding bottom
            2 is spacer times .5 
            4 is spacer times 1.5 

Flex
    There are a few classes provided by Bootstrap that just apply flexbox rules to elements.

    Note that using these classes can conflict with rows and columns. That doesn't mean that you can't use them altogether; just be wary of overlapping styles.
