JavaScript and the DOM
Connecting HTML and JavaScript

overview: learn how to add script elements to HTML and connect external JavaScript files to HTML pages. JavaScript brings the life to the page.


Terms:
    Document Object Model: DOM, the data representation of the HTML elements that make up the structure of a web page, serving as away for JavaScript to understand the structure of an HTML page in order to make it dynamic.

    child element: an element that's nested inside another element

    parent element: an element that has one or more elements nested inside it


The script tag 
    To include some JavaScript on a page, add an HTML script tag to the BOTTOM of the <body> element. The script tag takes an attribute named src; this attribute specifies the JavaScript file to be included. Here's an example:

    <script src="/path/to/your/script.js"></script>

    If your browser happens across a script tag when it's rendering a requested web page, it will request the file and execute it immediately.

    Referencing index.html and index.js files within the thinkful/dothis/jsDOM20/ folder.

        Add the following code to the index.html file
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8" />
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
            <title>JavaScript on your page</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
            <script src="index.js"></script>
          </body>
        </html>

        Add the following code to the index.js file 
            console.log("Hello!");

        Using developer tools in the browser, you can see that the js code is executed as the page loads.


Embedding JavaScript
    Best to avoid this, as it isn't very scalable.
    
    But you would add this directly to the html page.
        <script>console.log("This is embedded JS")</script>


The <noscript> tag 
    Some users deliberately turn off scripts or may be unable to run scripts for a number of reasons. At the very least, you should show these users a message indicating that the website depends on scripts. To do so, use the <noscript> tag, like this:
        <noscript>This site requires JavaScript.</noscript>
    
    To view this on your own computer, you will need to temporarily disable JavaScript in your browser.


Document Object Model
    When your web page is loaded by the browser, it is parsed, and the browser constructs an internal representation of the HTML.
    
    You can also use JavaScript to interact with the HTML via this internal representation. 
        This representation, which is called the Document Object Model (DOM), is the data representation of the HTML elements that make up the structure of a web page.
        
        The DOM is how the browser sees your HTML.

        Consider the following code:
        <html lang="en">
            <head>
              <meta charset="UTF-8" />
              <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
              <title>JavaScript on your page</title>
            </head>
            <body>
              <header>
                <h1>List of Parks</h1>
              </header>
              <main>
                <ul>
                  <li>Biscayne</li>
                  <li>Grand Canyon</li>
                  <li>Gateway Arch</li>
                  <li>Indiana Dunes</li>
                </ul>
              </main>
            </body>
        </html>

        Notice that the entire document is encolosed in the <html> element.
            The <html> element is called the root of the DOM.

        We can see that there are two elements directly inside the <html> element (the parent): 
            the children (the <head> and the <body>)

            <head>(parent)
                (meta, meta, title) children

            <body>(parent)
                (header, main) children
                    header (parent)
                        (ul) child
                    main (parent)
                        (ul) child
                            (li,li,li,li) children

        Resembles a family tree just with a singular parent, family tree terminology is used when talking about the relationships between the elements of the DOM.
