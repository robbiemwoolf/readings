//What method should you use?
    //At this point, you might be wondering which method of declaring variables you should use. Here's the process that you should follow when determining whether to use let, const, or var:

        //Use const primarily; this will be your go-to. Moving forward, you'll want to declare most of your variables using const.

        //Use let if you need to reassign a value. This is a common requirement during for loops and sometimes with if statements.

        //Don't use var unless necessary, like when working in a codebase that uses it. However, that will likely only happen in the distant future. As mentioned above, there are other reasons to use (and to not use) var, but those will be covered in a different lesson. For now, just avoid it.
