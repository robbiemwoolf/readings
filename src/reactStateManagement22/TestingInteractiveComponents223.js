// React State Management 22

// Testing Interactive Components 22.3

// overview: In the previous module, you learned how to write basic automated tests for your components using the React Testing Library and Jest. You wrote smoke tests to verify that your components can render without throwing errors. You also learned to write tests to ensure that components are rendering the correct content when given different kinds of props. As your React components become more complex, you can also write tests to cover other common use cases. For example, your tests can simulate user interactions with the component (such as clicking a button in a React component) and mock asynchronous operations (such as making an API call) that occur within a component.

// Learning How To Learn

    // Keep in mind that the purpose of the Learning how to learn lessons in this module is to give you the opportunity to acquire new knowledge and skills through independent research and learning. This is one of the most important skills that you need to develop and practice as a software developer over your career: learning new things and relearning things that you already "know."

    // To further reinforce what you've learned on your own, it's a good idea to explain and discuss your new knowledge with a classmate.

// Thinking Like A Developer

    // Developer documentation is one of the most important tools for software developers. Developer documentation helps developers interface with a given software service or library. As a software developer, you'll often refer to documentation to understand how to use a language or library.

    // Good documentation typically contains these basic elements: Introduction, Example, Setup, FAQ

// Key Questions

    // What are integration tests? How do they differ from unit tests?

    // Why use React Testing Library? What are its guiding principles?

    // What are the steps involved in setting up a test with the React Testing Library to test a user interaction (such as a click)?

    // What are mocks, and why would mocks be used in testing?

    // What are some ways you could mock, for example, an API request in your test code (are there libraries that make this easier)?

// Key Concepts and Syntax

    // fireEvent.change()

    // fireEvent.click()

    // fireEvent.submit()

    // jest.clearAllMocks()

    // jest.fn()

    // jest.mock()

    // jest.spyOn()
