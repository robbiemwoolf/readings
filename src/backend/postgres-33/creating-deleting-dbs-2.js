// terms: 

    // hosted database: also called a managed database, a cloud-computing service in which the end user pays a cloud service provider for access to a database

// Hosted Databases

    // Unlike a local database, you don't have to set up or maintain a hosted database on your own; rather, it's the provider's responsibility to oversee the database's infrastructure. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time installing, configuring, and updating your database.

// Creating and Deleting Databases

    // The free databases hosted on ElephantSQL cost the company a little bit of money for every second that each database exists. To ensure that the free database service continues to be free, you should promptly delete your database as soon as you are done with it. Even if you are only going to stop using the database for a short amount of time, it is best to extract the data, delete the database, and then create a new database later when you need it.
